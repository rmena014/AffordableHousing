     <h1>About Us</h1>
     <p>
       RCRH is a non -profit home organization in the Carolinas and we offers
       low-cost mortgages and down payment assistance for qualified home buyers
       whose needs are not met by the market. We finances the development of
       housing for people with special needs and provide foreclosure prevention
       assistance and access to housing counseling services. When working with
       CRRH you work with integrity and professionalism of our staff,
       management and partners. Here we do what we say we will do and manage
       resources wisely. There are quarterly meetings so our donors know how
       and where their hard earned money is going.

     <p class="art1">Between 2014 and 2020 the United States saw a steady increase in house prices of roughly five percent each month when compared to that same month the year before. While the five percent growth is in itself interesting, and can clearly be tied to those much wider housing market trends, the shocking rise seen in 2021 of between 12 and 16 percent from the previous year indicates a specific cause: Occamâ€™s Razor would suggest the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
